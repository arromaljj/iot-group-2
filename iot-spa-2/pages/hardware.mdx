## Components

**ESP8266:** The ESP8266, a compact and affordable Wi-Fi microchip, has become a staple in IoT and DIY projects. It features a 32-bit microcontroller, integrated memory, and multiple GPIO pins, making it versatile for various applications. Its onboard Wi-Fi capability allows it to connect to networks or act as an access point, and it includes an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) for sensor interfacing. It is commonly programmed through the Arduino IDE but is also compatible with Lua and the Espressif SDK. Popular in smart home devices, IoT sensors, and automation systems, the ESP8266 is favoured for its ease of use and strong community support, appealing to hobbyists, educators, and professionals alike.

**Micro Limit Switch:** A micro limit switch is an electromechanical device widely used in various industrial and consumer applications for controlling machinery and devices based on an object's physical movement or presence. It operates on a simple mechanism: when an object comes into contact with the actuator of the switch, it triggers a set of contacts to either make or break an electrical connection. This action can initiate, halt, or modify a process or operation in a machine. Micro-limit switches are known for their reliability, durability, and quick response time. They are typically small, making them suitable for applications where space is limited. Commonly found in automatic control systems, door mechanisms, and safety interlock systems, these switches are essential to ensure operational safety and efficiency in industrial and everyday settings. Their design can vary, including different actuator types like rollers, plungers, or levers, to suit specific application needs.

**Breadboard:** A breadboard is a fundamental tool in electronics, widely used for prototyping and experimenting with circuit designs. It consists of a rectangular plastic board with a grid of holes into which electronic components like resistors, transistors, and integrated circuits can be inserted and interconnected without the need for soldering. The holes are typically connected by metal strips underneath, creating rows and columns of electrically common points, allowing for easy assembly and modification of circuits. Breadboards are particularly favoured in educational settings and by hobbyists for their reusability and the convenience they offer in testing and debugging circuits. They come in various sizes and often include areas for a power supply and additional modules, making them versatile tools for developing a wide range of electronic projects, from simple educational experiments to complex prototypes.

**Jumper Wires:** Jumper wires are essential components in electronics, mainly used in prototyping and testing circuits on breadboards or connecting components on other types of prototyping boards. They are small wires with connector pins at each end, which can be either male or female, designed to fit into the holes of a breadboard or the sockets of electronic components. These wires allow for circuits' easy and temporary construction without soldering, facilitating quick modifications and adjustments. Jumper wires come in various lengths and colours, and the latter is often used to maintain colour-coded organization of connections for clarity and ease of troubleshooting. Their flexibility and ease of use make them indispensable in electronic prototyping, educational projects, and DIY experiments, enabling beginners and experienced practitioners to efficiently test and iterate circuit designs.

**Battery:** A battery will supply the components' electricity in the finished configuration.

## Hardware Architecture

Client and bridge nodes are developed utilizing the ESP8266 in the outlined architecture. The function of the client nodes is to monitor sit-in activities, which they accomplish through inputs from tactile microlimit switches. On the other hand, the bridge node's role is confined to transmitting and receiving messages from these client nodes. This node forwards the collected data to the gateway via serial communication, from where it is relayed to remote applications through the MQTT protocol. The Software Design section contains further information regarding the communication protocols employed.

In the architecture of the client node, a micro limit switch is methodically connected, with one terminal linked to the D1 pin of the ESP8266 controller and the opposite terminal interfaced with the 3V pin. Activation of the micro limit switch, achieved through pressing, completes the circuit, thereby facilitating the reception of signals by the controller. Moreover, a connection is established between the D0 pin of the controller and the RST pin. This particular configuration is instrumental in integrating an effective sleep mechanism within the circuit design, a feature that substantially contributes to the enhancement of the device's operational lifespan.

Further, the ESP's G pin is connected to the ground, ensuring the completion of necessary circuit interconnections. Power to the ESP8266 is supplied through the micro-USB port on the board. In the definitive version of this setup, a battery is utilized as the power source, selected specifically based on the system's longevity requirements. For the purposes of experimental demonstration, both client and bridge nodes receive power via a USB cable, which is connected to an independent computer system. This setup underscores the practicality and adaptability of the system in various testing scenarios.
