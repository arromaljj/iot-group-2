# Critical Analysis


The Client module is examined to quantitatively assess the device's lifespan. According to the sources regarding the performance of similar applications, the average duration for different activities is as stated below:

                                        *Fig 3.1: Activity time for micro limit switch*



Total Sampling Time = 5040 mS

Active Sampling Duty Cycle = Push Button Engagement / Total Time = 0.0009920634921

Active Processing Duty Cycle = Processing Time / Total Time = 0.005952380952

Active Transmission Duty Cycle = Transmission Time / Total Time = 0.0009920634921

Inactive Sampling Time = 1 - Active Sampling Duty Cycle = 0.9990079365

Inactive Processing Time = 1 - Active Processing Duty Cycle =0.994047619

Inactive Transmission Time  = 1 - Active Transmission Duty Cycle = 0.9990079365

Total Active Time = Active Sampling Duty Cycle + Active Processing Duty Cycle + Active Transmission Duty Cycle = 0.007936507937

Total Inactive Time = Inactive Sampling Time + Inactive Processing Time + Inactive Transmission Time = 2.992063492

Therefore,

Total Power Consumed = Total Active Time * Operational Current + Total Inactive Time * Sleep Current = 0.7344444444 mA

For a Battery capacity of 2000 mAH

Life Time in Hours =2000 / Total Power Consumed  = 2723.146747 hours

Life Time in Days = Life Time in Hours / 24 = 113.4644478 Days

---

With a 5-second sleep interval, the device operates for up to 113 days. Adjusting the sleep time to 1 minute extends the device's lifespan to about 714 days. Increasing the battery capacity could further prolong this duration, though it would lead to a larger device size and potentially higher costs per client module unit.

An alternative approach could be implementing a machine learning algorithm that predicts and adjusts the sleep times of client modules based on usage patterns. This system would analyze historical data to optimize energy consumption without manual input. While more complex and potentially time-consuming to develop, this method offers a more automated, intelligent solution for managing the device's operational efficiency.
