Accurately identifying open seats in a variety of settings is a common and essential requirement, especially in public transit networks. The primary objective of this programme is to detect vacant seats on Lothian buses, a task critical to improving both customer satisfaction and operational effectiveness. Although there is some value in the current web-based solutions, they are not very scalable and cannot efficiently monitor more than a few hundred seats due to various issues. This creates a significant backlog, particularly in larger fleets and during rush hour.

This work explores a novel approach that makes use of an Internet of Things (IoT) implementation based on MQTT. The fundamental function of this system is the detection of occupied seats, which is accomplished by carefully placing pressure switches. The purpose of these switches is to detect if a passenger is present or not. Once turned on, they use a bridge node to send data to a central web server. Using the MQTT protocol is especially important since it can reliably transport data even in situations with low bandwidth and high latency. In a moving bus environment, where network conditions can be erratic and changing, this capability is essential.

MQTT's real-time feedback feature is yet another essential component of this system. The element that improves customer convenience and helps the transportation provider optimise route planning and bus scheduling is the ability to track and update seat occupancy status instantly. This instantaneous data flow guarantees that the system can deliver current information, which is essential for making decisions in real-time.

Moreover, this MQTT-based IoT system's scalability represents a major improvement over current solutions. Its robust and adaptable architecture allows it to grow to meet any capacity need, which makes it perfect for widespread deployment across sizable bus fleets. The system's ability to scale guarantees that it will continue to operate effectively and efficiently regardless of the size of the fleet or the number of passengers, which represents a major advancement in the administration of public transport and the provision of passenger services.
