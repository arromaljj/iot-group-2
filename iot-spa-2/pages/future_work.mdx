## Database Management and PowerBI Integration

In the current architecture, the client (administration) did not have real-time data analytics integrated with DBMS. The enhanced system introduces a database that precisely records passenger numbers at each bus stop, capturing boarding and alighting activities. This data allows for identifying passenger traffic trends across various buses and routes. By examining these trends over time, administrative decisions can be made more strategically to optimise the distribution or reduction of buses on specific routes. The data specific to each bus stop will be instrumental in modifying the capacity of stops in line with the passenger volume.

Integrating this database with PowerBI enables the development of a real-time analytics dashboard. The dashboard will provide administrators with a prompt and comprehensive overview of passenger traffic patterns, ensuring informed and timely decision-making. The use of PowerBI not only enhances data visualization but also simplifies the process of identifying and responding to changing passenger behaviours and route demands.

## Artificial Intelligence

Seat occupancy data is captured and stored in the cloud using a database like MongoDB. This information is analyzed to discern seat occupancy trends throughout the bus journey. Leveraging artificial intelligence, these patterns are used to predict seat availability, providing passengers with estimates of which seats will likely be free at their boarding point.
